# MIPS-Project
# NOTES:			
# - "does not require local storage" means each (leaf) function			
#   -- does not need memory on the stack for local variables (including arrays)			
#   -- WILL NOT use any callee-saved registers ($s0 through $s7)			
# - meant as an exercise for familiarizing w/ the			
#   -- basics of MIPS' function-call mechanism			
#   -- how-to's of pass-by-value & pass-by-address when doing functions in MIPS			
# - does NOT adhere to more-broadly-applicable function-call convention (which			
#   is needed when doing functions in general, not just "trivial" functions)			
# - main (being the only non-"trivial" function & an unavoidable one) will in 			
#   fact violate the yet-to-be-studied(?) function-call convention			
#   -- due to this, each of the functions that main calls MUST TAKE ANOMALOUS 			
#      CARE not to "clobber" the contents of registers that main uses & expects			
#      to be preserved across calls			
#   -- experiencing the pains and appreciating the undesirability of having to			
#      deal with the ANOMALOUS SITUATION (due to the non-observance of any			
#      function-call convention that governs caller-callee relationship) should			
#      help in understanding why some function-call convention must be defined			
#      and observed
